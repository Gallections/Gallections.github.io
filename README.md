# Gallections

## Introduction:
This is a website that is built using vinilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The project was built during the last year of my high school driven by my interest in JavaScript. Gallections is platform that assembles the top three 'classic' games (to be expanded in the future) in my opinion that I built from scratch without referring to the games' fundemental coding mechanisms. This platfrom allows users to play the classic games as a way to pasttime and stress-releive.
