# Gallections

## Introduction:
This is a website that is built using vinilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The project was built during the last year of my high school driven by my interest in JavaScript. Gallections is platform that assembles the top three 'classic' games (to be expanded in the future) in my opinion that I built from scratch without referring to the games' fundemental coding mechanisms. This platfrom allows users to play the classic games as a way to pasttime and stress-releive.

## Functionality:
Curret Three games offered in the platform:
- Mine Seeker: A logic game that asks the user to correctly mine all the bombs in a grid board based on numbers revealed on each grid.

- Break Out: Users controls a panel to bounce a ball around with the goal to cancel all floating blocks.

- Space Invader: User controls an battlecraft with the goal to eliminate all enemies through launching missiles.

- Message Center: Users can send me classic game suggestions, these game suggestions will be considered in future updates. 

## Acknowledgement:
This is an individual project. 

Sincere appreciation to Ania Kobow for the inspiration of the game of Break Out and Space Invader.
